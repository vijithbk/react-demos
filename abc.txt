You are a senior fullstack engineer and application security expert. Your task is to implement a secure backend feature for a fully functional Todo application.

Requirement:
Build a secure API endpoint or backend function that allows an authenticated user to "add a new todo item". Each todo item should include:
- title: a short string content
- description: a longer string
- completed: a boolean value (This should be a checkbox)
- tags: one or more words prefixed with a `#` (hashtags)

Functional Constraints:
- Only the "authenticated user" who created a todo can read, edit, or delete it.
- The system will later use `tags` to filter and sort todos.

Security Requirements:
You must ensure the code is protected from the following vulnerabilities:

1. Command Injection – Never pass user input directly into OS or system commands. Avoid exec, spawn etc.
2. Insecure Deserialization – If any serialization/deserialization is needed, avoid unsafe formats.
3. Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) – Enforce ownership checks. Ensure users can only modify their own todo items using proper user-to-resource validation.
4. Insecure Session Identifier – Assume session-based or token authentication is in place. Validate sessions using cryptographically strong tokens.
5. Secrets Exposure – Do not hardcode API keys, DB credentials, or secret values. Load secrets from environment variables or a secure secret manager.
6. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) – If your code makes HTTP requests, validate input.
7. SQL Injection – Use parameterized queries or an ORM. Never concatenate SQL strings with raw user input.
8. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) – Sanitize all input and output for frontend rendering. Assume output will be displayed in HTML and protect accordingly.
9. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) – If using cookie-based authentication, ensure CSRF protection via same-site cookies or CSRF tokens.
10. XML External Entity Injection (XXE) – If parsing XML, disable entity expansion and external DTDs.

Output:
1. A secure implementation of the "Add Todo Item" functionality that meets all the above security requirements.
2. Assume a backend environment like Node.js with Express.
3. Include short inline comments explaining security controls wherever applied.
4. Add a brief explanation at the top summarizing how each vulnerability is addressed.

Sample Test Cases to Include:
- Should successfully add a todo item with valid input
- Should convert hashtags into tag array (example: ["shopping", "urgent"])
- Should reject input containing script tags or dangerous characters
- Should deny unauthorized edits or deletions by other users
- Should not allow SQL injection payloads through input
- Should reject requests lacking valid CSRF tokens
- Should generate unpredictable and secure session IDs
- Should validate environment-based secrets are used and not hardcoded
- Should block SSRF or command injection attempts via input
- Should reject insecure XML input if any deserialization or XML parsing is introduced
- Use Node.js with Express, MongoDB with Mongoose for the data layer, and JWT for session management.

Use Node.js with Express, MongoDB with Mongoose for the data layer, and JWT for session management.

You are a senior full-stack engineer and application security specialist. Your task is to implement secure backend and frontend code for a Todo application with two features: a Dashboard Page and an Update Page.

Functional Requirements:

1. Dashboard Page:
   - Display all todo items created by the currently logged-in user.
   - For each todo item, display:
     - title
     - description
     - completed status (checkbox)
     - tags (prefixed by `#`)
   - Provide buttons to update and delete each item.

2. Update Page:
   - Allow the user to create a new todo item or update an existing one.
   - Fields: title, description, completed and tags.

Security Requirements:
Ensure that your implementation protects against the following vulnerabilities:
1. Command Injection 
   - Do not use or expose shell/OS command execution in any form.

2. Insecure Deserialization
   - Use only safe formats like JSON. Do not use `eval` etc.

3. Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) 
   - Ensure only the authenticated user can access, update, or delete their own todo items.
   - Enforce object ownership checks on all actions.

4. Insecure Session Identifier
   - Use secure, cryptographically generated tokens
   - Ensure tokens are properly signed, stored securely (e.g., HttpOnly, Secure cookies).

5. Secrets Exposure 
   - Do not hardcode secrets. Load them from environment variables or secure vaults.
   - Mask secrets in logs and error messages.

6. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) 
   - If there is any user-supplied URL (for example, in future tag features), validate inputs.

7. SQL Injection
   - Use parameterized queries or ORM with input sanitization. Do not construct raw queries using user input.

8. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
   - Sanitize user inputs before rendering.
   - Use escaping libraries or frontend frameworks that prevent raw HTML injection.

9. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) 
   - If cookie-based sessions are used, implement CSRF tokens or SameSite cookie policies.

10. XML Entity Injection (XXE)
   - If parsing XML (even via config or third-party modules), disable external entity resolution.

Output Required:
1. A secure backend implementation (assume Node.js with Express).
2. A secure frontend rendering logic for the dashboard and update pages.
3. Inline comments indicating where and how each of the above vulnerabilities is mitigated.
4. A 5–10 line summary at the top of the code explaining how your code defends against each vulnerability.
5. Do not use insecure libraries, and avoid excessive boilerplate—focus on security in code logic.

Example Stack:
Use Node.js with Express + MongoDB (Mongoose) and JWT for session management. Frontend may use React templates.

==============================================================================================================
You are a senior full-stack engineer and application security expert. Your task is to design and implement a secure tagging system for a Todo application.

Functional Requirement:

- Users should be able to add tags to their todo items.
- Each tag must be displayed with a hashtag prefix (e.g., #urgent, #tomorrow).
- A todo item can have multiple tags.
- Only the authenticated user should be able to create, view, edit, or delete tags associated with their todo items.

Security Requirements:
Your code must address and protect against the following vulnerabilities:

1. Command Injection 
   - Do not run or embed any shell/OS-level commands with user input.

2. Insecure Deserialization
   - Use safe formats like JSON. Do not use unsafe deserialization mechanisms.

3. Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
   - Ensure users cannot view or modify tags/todos belonging to other users.

4. Insecure Session Identifier
   - Use strong, securely generated session tokens

5. Secrets Exposure 
   - Avoid hardcoding API keys, database credentials or tokens.
   - Load all sensitive data through environment variables.

6. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)  
   - If any external URL or lookup is involved (ex: future enhancements like tag suggestions), ensure IP filtering and input validation are in place.

7. SQL Injection
   - Use parameterized queries or an ORM. Do not build raw SQL using string concatenation.

8. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) 
   - Sanitize all tag inputs.
   - Escape tag values on output to prevent script injection via tags like <script>#urgent</script>.

9. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
   - Use CSRF protection or cookie policies if session-based auth is used.

10. XML Entity Injection (XXE)
   - If parsing any XML (ex: in configs or imports), disable external entities.

Output Required:

1. Backend code to:
   - Create and attach a tag to a todo item.
   - Ensure only the owner of the todo can tag it.
   - Store tags cleanly (normalized and secure).
   - Prevent duplicate or malformed tags.

2. Frontend code to:
   - Display tags with hashtags.
   - Sanitize and render safely.
   - Allow users to add new tags to a todo item.

3. Include comments in the code indicating how each of the vulnerabilities has been addressed.

Test Cases to Include:

Should add valid tags and store them in normalized format.

Should reject tags containing scripts, HTML, or command-like strings.

Should return 403 if user attempts to modify another user’s tags or todo items.

Should enforce CSRF protection for tag-related operations.

Should escape output correctly when displaying tags to avoid XSS.

Should reject SQL injection patterns in tags.

Should reject deserialization of unexpected objects (if applicable).

Should not execute any command-like patterns submitted through tag input.

Should verify that all secrets are referenced via environment variables and not hardcoded.

Should reject tag requests using disallowed internal URLs if SSRF applies.

Now, implement this feature securely with all the above considerations.

Example Stack:
If you need a base tech stack, assume:
- Backend: Node.js + Express + MongoDB (with Mongoose)
- Frontend: React or EJS templates
